Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten digit recognition using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on the MNIST dataset.


This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using a artificial neural network (ANN).
The model is trained on MNIST dataset to classify digits from 0 to 9.
This project also demonstrates the making of a neural network, including forward propagation, backpropagation and model evaluation.

Technologies used:
1. Python
2. PyTorch
3. Matplotlib
4. MNIST dataset

I have made this project as a part of my Internship training.
